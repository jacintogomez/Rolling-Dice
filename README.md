# Rolling-Dice

Small assignment for my Java class where we are tasked with making a mini game with Java GUI. This simulation "rolls" two dice and moves a dot along a grid based on the number rolled. The game is finished when the dot reaches the last box in the grid.

Code for this is contained in the sub-folder titled PartIV
